_This is a mirror of my C++ solutions for some of the_ [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) _problems_ in various languages.

# "But You Shouldn't Publish Your Solutions !"

Project Euler encourages you **NOT** to publish solutions.

I have a different point of view:
* 99% of my knowledge is based on things I was taught, I saw somewhere or I stumbled across
* and maybe 1% is "original"
* I'm pretty sure it's not just me - it's the way how all of us gain knowledge

So it boils down to:
* having a good teacher
* access to well-equipped library
* and probably most important today: your skills in working with a search engine

If someone visits my website/repository then he/she already realized that he/she can't solve that problem and is doing the right thing: ask someone.
That's the only way how knowledge can be spread - all famous scientists wrote books.
[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) was one of the most productive mathematicians and he published 866 papers/books/etc. He shared his knowledge.
And a substantial number of my solutions is based on some of his formulas, I only solved them because I could look up his works.

Admittedly, there is no use in publishing lists of the results to Project Euler problems. 
Because these numbers don't teach you anything.
